# Transformer-Test-Model
**Mathematical Model Using Simulink**

This model uses open and close circuit test data of a transformer to find
1. The equivalent circuit parameters with reference to the secondary side of transformer.
2. Power factor during open and close circuit test.
3. Voltage regulation. 
4. Efficiency.
5. Voltage regulation versus load current plot.
